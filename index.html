                                <p>The first instances of kimono-like garments in Japan were traditional Chinese clothing introduced to Japan via Chinese envoys in the Kofun period (300–538 CE; the first part of the Yamato period), through immigration between the two countries and envoys to the Tang dynasty court leading to Chinese styles of dress, appearance, and culture becoming extremely popular in Japanese court society.The Imperial Japanese court quickly adopted Chinese styles of dress and clothing,with evidence of the oldest samples of shibori tie-dyed fabric stored at the Shōsōin Temple being of Chinese origin, due to the limitations of Japan's ability to produce the fabrics at the time.As early as the 4th century CE, images of priestess-queens and tribal chiefs in Japan depicted figures wearing clothing similar that of Han dynasty China.</p>

                                <h2>Heian period to Azuchi–Momoyama period (794–1600)</h2>
                                <p>During the Heian period (794–1193 CE), Japan stopped sending envoys to the Chinese dynastic courts. This prevented Chinese-imported goods—including clothing—from entering the Imperial Palace. This also prevented dissemination to the upper classes, who were the main arbiters of traditional Japanese culture at the time, and the only people allowed to wear such clothing.The ensuing cultural vacuum facilitated the development of a Japanese culture independent from Chinese fashions. Elements previously lifted from the Tang Dynastic courts developed independently into what is known literally as "national culture" or "kokufū culture" (国風文化, kokufū-bunka). The term is used to refer to Heian-period Japanese culture, particularly that of the upper classes.</p>

                                <p>During the Edo period (1603–1867 CE), both Japan's culture and economy developed significantly. A particular factor in the development of the Edo period was the early Genroku period (1688–1704 CE), wherein "Genroku culture" – luxurious displays of wealth and increased patronage of the arts – led to the further development of many art forms, including those of clothing. Genroku culture was led by the growing and increasingly-powerful merchant classes (chōnin), whose clothing was representative of their increasing economic power and rivaled the aristocracy and samurai classes, shown by their brightly-coloured kimono that utilised expensive production techniques, such as hand-painted dyework. Rinzu, a damask fabric, also became the preferred material for kimono at this time, replacing the previously-popular nerinuki plain-weave silk, which had been used to create tsujigahana.</p>

                                <p>It was during the Taishō period that the modern formalisation of kimono and kimono types began to emerge. The Meiji period had seen the slow introduction of kimono types that mediated between the informal and the most formal, a trend that continued throughout the Taishō period, as social occasions and opportunities for leisure increased under the abolition of class distinctions. As Western clothing increased in popularity for men as everyday clothing, the kimono industry further established its own traditions of formal and informal dress for women; this saw the invention of the hōmongi, divisions of tomesode (short-sleeved) kimono for women, and montsuki hakama.</p>

                        The yukata (浴衣) is a casual version of the kimono. It is a robe usually made of cotton or synthetic fabric, wrapped around the body and fastened with a sash (obi). Yukata literally means "bathing cloth", and it was originally intended to be just that. Traditionally, the garment is worn after bathing in a communal bath, functioning as a quick way to cover the body and to absorb remaining moisture.
                    </p>
                    <p class="section-description">
                        Fittingly, the yukata is often worn in hot spring (onsen) towns. It is also the typical dress for guests at ryokan. Visiting an onsen town can provides the enjoyable experience of strolling the streets in yukata and geta (wooden clogs), producing scenes reminiscent of past centuries.
                    </p>
                    <p class="section-description">
                        The yukata has also become a popular way of dressing for summer festivals. Increasingly fashionable designs have surfaced to a degree that it is sometimes difficult for the untrained eye to discern between a yukata and a kimono. Yukata for men generally have darker or more subdued colors, while that for young women are usually bright and colorful, often with floral designs. Yukata for matured women tend to be less flashy.

                    <p class="section-description">
                        The kimono usually just comes in one size, although distinctions are made between what men, women, and children wear. When choosing which kimono to wear, people think about the designs and materials that best match the season and how well it goes with the belt, which, in the case of women's formal attire, is about 10 inches wide and is elaborately decorated.                    </p>
                    <p class="section-description">
                        Most kimonos are made of silk, although they also come in cotton, wool, and linen. Compared to Western dress, the kimono tends to limit one's movement, and it takes more time to wear and store properly. So most Japanese today wear kimonos only on special occasions like formal gatherings and traditional events.
                    </p>
                    <p class="section-description">
                        Examples include the New Year holidays, the Shichi-go-san festival to pray for the healthy growth of children, weddings and funerals, the coming-of-age ceremony to mark one's twentieth birthday, and the graduation ceremony. Except for the Shichi-go-san festival for kids, it's usually just the women who wear kimonos.

                    <p class="section-description">
                        A traditional version of a yukata is most commonly made from cotton. <br>
                        This is for two main reasons: firstly it’s one of the most comfortable and breathable fabrics, ideal for Japan’s long hot summers. 
                    </p>
                    <p class="section-description">
                        Secondly, cotton is quick to dry, making it the ideal material for soaking up any extra moisture left on the body post-bath. Modern yukata designed to be worn at festivals are also sometimes made from synthetic materials, which can be even more efficient at evaporating moisture away from the skin.
                    </p>
                    <p class="section-description">
                        Perhaps the most obvious difference between a kimono and yukata, at least if you’re wearing it yourself, is that kimono usually (although not always) have an interior lining, whereas yukata never do, and are sewn from a single layer of fabric.

                    <p class="section-description">
                        The yukata is quite similar to a bathrobe or dressing gown in terms of style, and is usually worn with less formality and accessories than a kimono. 
                    </p>
                    <p class="section-description">
                        Expensive silk or ornately decorated kimono are very rarely washed, so are worn with an inner layer, known as a nagajuban, which keeps the outer garment clean and dry. Yukata on the other hand are much easier to clean, and so are usually worn without a nagajuban.

                        Yukata are festive, and are often worn for parties, festivals, and events such as firework displays. Unlike kimono, however, they are not worn at formal ceremonial events.

                        Although it may be difficult to tell the difference for an outsider, wearing a thin, brightly-colored yukata to an auspicious occasion might come across as too casual!
